  "objective": "The origins of queueing theory can be found in stochastic processes, and it is frequently utilised in operations research, probability, and statistics. Chemical kinetics,dynamic systems, telecommunications, computer systems, wireless networks, and financial mathematics are only a few of the applications. The main goal of this virtual lab is to create a software application that will assist students in comprehending and visualising queue principles, as well as providing them with the essential insight to apply queueing systems to real-world issues",
