  "introduction": "Queuing Theory and Modelling is a vital area of operations research and applied mathematics that focuses on analysing and optimizing systems where waiting lines (queues) form. These systems are ubiquitous, found in everyday scenarios such as customer service lines, computer networks, manufacturing processes, and telecommunications. The Queuing Theory and Modelling Virtual Lab provides an interactive platform for students, researchers, and professionals to explore and understand the fundamental principles and advanced concepts of queuing theory. Through a series of simulations and experiments, users can model real-world queuing systems, observe their behaviour, and analyse performance metrics such as wait times, queue lengths, and system eXiciency. This virtual lab allows users to experiment with diXerent queue configurations, service disciplines, and arrival patterns, making it easier to visualize and comprehend the impact of various parameters on system performance.",
